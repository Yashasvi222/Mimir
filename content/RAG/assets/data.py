data = """To reduce the environmental impact and climate footprint of the Paris 2024 Games, the Olympic venues served twice as much plant-based food as was available in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Vegan chicken nuggets and vegan hot dogs were offered instead of meat-based varieties. Venues for spectators served, on average, two-thirds plant-based meals. The Place de la Concorde, which hosted the skateboarding, breakdancing, and BMX events, served only plant-based food. The football stadiums provided 40% plant-based options, and about 30% of the meals served to athletes in the Olympic Village were plant-based. An estimate indicated that 13 million meals would be served at the Games, with around 40,000 meals each day, including 1,200 Michelin-starred options. Each day, a boulangerie baked fresh baguettes and other breads. A 3,500-seat restaurant was constructed for the Games to highlight global cuisine. Great Britain's team requested porridge be added to the menu, and South Korea's team asked for kimchi. Throughout the Games, various athletes and competitors in the Olympic Village complained about certain foods, such as eggs and grilled meats, not being available in sufficient quantities. British athletes reportedly expressed concerns about raw meat being served, leading many to avoid the Olympic Village dining facilities and eat elsewhere. The British Olympic Association flew in chefs to ensure the nourishment of British athletes at a location outside the Olympic Village."""
